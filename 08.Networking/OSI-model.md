# 🌐 OSI Model - Easy Explanation

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into 7 different layers. It helps different systems communicate with each other.

## 📚 The 7 Layers of OSI Model

| Layer | Name              | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 7     | Application       | Interface for end-users and apps (e.g., browsers, email). |
| 6     | Presentation      | Formats and encrypts data (e.g., JPEG, SSL). |
| 5     | Session           | Manages sessions and connections (e.g., login sessions). |
| 4     | Transport         | Ensures complete data transfer (e.g., TCP, UDP). |
| 3     | Network           | Routes data between devices (e.g., IP address, routers). |
| 2     | Data Link         | Handles data frames between two directly connected nodes. |
| 1     | Physical          | Transmits raw bit stream over physical medium (e.g., cables, switches). |

## 📦 Example: Sending a Message

1. **User types message in chat app** (Application Layer)
2. Message is **formatted and encrypted** (Presentation)
3. **Session is established** between devices (Session)
4. Message is **broken into packets** (Transport)
5. Each packet gets a **destination IP** (Network)
6. Packets are **framed and MAC addressed** (Data Link)
7. Sent as **electrical signals or bits** through cable or Wi-Fi (Physical)
