# Creating and Executing a Shell Script on an EC2 Ubuntu Instance

## 1. Connect to Your EC2 Instance
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
````

## 2. Create a Shell Script File Using Vim

```bash
vim sample-shell-script.sh
```

## 3. Add the Following Commands in the Script

Press `i` to enter insert mode, then add:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create directory ABC
mkdir -p ABC

# Change into ABC directory
cd ABC

# Create two files
touch first-file second-file
```

Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` to save and exit.

## 4. Give Execute Permission to the Script

```bash
chmod +x sample-shell-script.sh
```

## 5. Run the Shell Script

```bash
./sample-shell-script.sh
```

## 6. Verify the Result

```bash
ls -l ABC
```

Expected output:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Sep 14 12:00 first-file
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Sep 14 12:00 second-file
```


# Commands Used in the Shell Script with Explanations

## 1. `#!/bin/bash`
- This is called a **shebang**.
- It tells the system to execute the script using the **Bash shell**.

---

## 2. `mkdir -p ABC`
- `mkdir` is used to **create a new directory**.
- The `-p` flag ensures that no error is thrown if the directory already exists.

---

## 3. `cd ABC`
- Changes the **current working directory** to `ABC`.
- This ensures that any files created next are placed inside the `ABC` folder.

---

## 4. `touch first-file second-file`
- The `touch` command is used to **create empty files**.
- Here, it creates two empty files named `first-file` and `second-file` inside the `ABC` directory.

---

## 5. `chmod +x sample-shell-script.sh`
- `chmod` changes file permissions.
- The `+x` flag makes the shell script **executable**.

---

## 6. `./sample-shell-script.sh`
- Executes the shell script from the **current directory** using `./`.

---

## 7. `ls -l ABC`
- Lists the contents of the `ABC` directory in **long format**.
- Useful for verifying that `first-file` and `second-file` were successfully created.
