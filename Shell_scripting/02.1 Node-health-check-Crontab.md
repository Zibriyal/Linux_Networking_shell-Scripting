 Let's walk through everything you need to **schedule your `node-health.sh` script to run every minute using cron**

---

### ✅ Step-by-step Guide:

#### ✅ 1. **Make Your Script Executable**

First, give your script the permission to run.

Open terminal and run:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/node-health.sh
```

> 🔁 Replace `/path/to/node-health.sh` with the actual full path to your script.
> Example: `/home/ec2-user/node-health.sh`

---

#### ✅ 2. **Test the Script Manually**

Before using cron, make sure it runs fine:

```bash
/path/to/node-health.sh
```

---

#### ✅ 3. **Open Crontab (Your Cron Job List)**

Run:

```bash
crontab -e
```

> This opens the cron job editor for your current user.

---

#### ✅ 4. **Add a Cron Job to Run Every Minute**

Add the following line at the bottom of the file:

```cron
* * * * * /path/to/node-health.sh >> /path/to/node-health.log 2>&1
```

✅ What this does:

* `* * * * *` → every minute
* `/path/to/node-health.sh` → the script to run
* `>> /path/to/node-health.log` → save the output into a log file
* `2>&1` → include error messages in the same log

> Example:

```cron
* * * * * /home/ec2-user/node-health.sh >> /home/ec2-user/node-health.log 2>&1
```

---

#### ✅ 5. **Save and Exit**

If using the default editor (like nano):

* Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`

---

#### ✅ 6. **Check If It Works**

Wait 1-2 minutes, then check the log:

```bash
cat /path/to/node-health.log
```

You should see the disk space, memory, and CPU output every minute.

### ✅ Summary

Your script runs every minute using cron by:

* Giving it execute permission (`chmod +x`)
* Adding a line to `crontab -e`
* Logging output to a file
